# The Web Application Security 

Welcome to the Web Application Security project repository! This project aims to provide resources, tools, and guidelines for improving the security of web applications. With the increasing number of cyber threats targeting web applications, it's essential to adopt best practices and techniques to mitigate risks and protect sensitive data.

The site acts as a repository for SecurityFeature whereby users can store their own SecurityFeature and also browse other users' SecurityFeature and bookmark them for a later date. Users can get organised for the week ahead by adding SecurityFeature to their tech security for each time.

### Design

The site features a deliberately simple and clean design, chosen to harmonize with its overarching goal: to evoke a sense of calmness in users and alleviate stress associated with everyday security checks.

#### Colour Scheme
Colour palette from Coolors

![Colour Palette](docs/readme_images/colour_scheme.png)

The colour scheme of the site is Anti Flash White, Night, Gunmetal and Gelesial Blue with thin gold borders. The colours chosen are quite neutral and calming. 

Night was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility. 

#### Imagery
There are two static images on the site depicting a person walking across a computer to explain Web Application Security on the home page. The rest of the imagery will be uploaded by users for their individual security features.

#### Fonts
The main font used for the body of the website is sans-serif, while Playfair Display is used for the main headings on the home page. These fonts have been imported via Google Fonts. In the event that the main font fails to import correctly, Sans Serif serves as the backup font.

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/Noah-Samawi/projects/12/views/1?layout=board)

The 6 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Data Model
I utilized Object-Oriented Programming principles extensively throughout this project, leveraging Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views. Django AllAuth served as the user authentication system.

To enable users to create security features, a custom SecurityFeature model was implemented. The 'author' of a security feature is represented as a foreign key to the User model, as each security feature is associated with only one author.

The Comment model facilitates users' ability to comment on individual security features. A security feature is referenced as a foreign key in the Comment model, ensuring that each comment is linked to only one security feature.

Additionally, the SecurityFeature model allows users to add security features to a tech security for a specific day. Each tech security item is associated with one user and one security feature, achieved through foreign key relationships with the User and SecurityFeature models.

The diagram below details the database schema.

![Database Schema](docs/readme_images/database_schema.png)

## Testing

Testing and results can be found [here](/TESTING.md)

## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User Authentication

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. 
- Django's UserPassesTestMixin is used to limit access based on certain permissions i.e. to ensure users can only edit/delete securityfeatures and comments for which they are the author. If the user doesn't pass the test they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error. 

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom error pages

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request - The Tech Security is unable to handle this request.
- 403 Page Forbidden - Looks like you're trying to access forbidden content. Please log out and sign in to the correct account.
- 404 Page Not Found - The page you're looking for doesn't exist.
- 500 Server Error - The Tech Security is currently unable to handle this request

- Within the call-to-action section, there is a sign-up button that directs users to the sign-up page.
- If a user is already signed in, the message on the call-to-action section changes to 'Welcome back to The Work Safely,' and the user is prompted to create a new security feature.
- The sign-up button transforms into a 'Create' button, which, upon clicking, takes the user to the 'Add Security Feature' page.

### Future Features
The following user stories were scoped out of the project due to time constraints and labelled as "Could Have" on the project board in Github. It is intended that these user stories will be implemented at a later date.

## Deployment - Heroku

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

### Create the Heroku App:
- Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
- Next select your region.
- Click on the Create App button.

### Attach the Postgres database:
- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.
- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.

### Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
- In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
- Update the settings.py file to import the env.py file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
- Comment out the default database configuration.
- Save files and make migrations.
- Add Cloudinary URL to env.py
- Add the cloudinary libraries to the list of installed apps.
- Add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.
- Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku.
- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

### Create files / directories
- Create requirements.txt file
- Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi

### Update Heroku Config Vars
Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:
- SECRET_KEY value
- CLOUDINARY_URL
- PORT = 8000
- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
