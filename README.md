# The Web Application Security 
# Web Application Security

Welcome to the Web Application Security project repository! This project aims to provide resources, tools, and guidelines for improving the security of web applications. With the increasing number of cyber threats targeting web applications, it's essential to adopt best practices and techniques to mitigate risks and protect sensitive data.

The site acts as a repository for SecurityFeature whereby users can store their own SecurityFeature and also browse other users' SecurityFeature and bookmark them for a later date. Users can get organised for the week ahead by adding SecurityFeature to their tech security for each time.

### Design

The site features a deliberately simple and clean design, chosen to harmonize with its overarching goal: to evoke a sense of calmness in users and alleviate stress associated with everyday security checks.

#### Colour Scheme
Colour palette from Coolors

![Colour Palette](docs/readme_images/colour_scheme.png)

The colour scheme of the site is Anti Flash White, Night, Gunmetal and Gelesial Blue with thin gold borders. The colours chosen are quite neutral and calming. 

Night was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility. 

#### Imagery
There is tow static images on the site depicting a family dinner on the home page. The rest of the imagery will be uploaded by users for their individual securityfeatures. 

#### Fonts
The main font used for the body of the website is sans-serif, while Playfair Display is used for the main headings on the home page. These fonts have been imported via Google Fonts. In the event that the main font fails to import correctly, Sans Serif serves as the backup font.

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/Noah-Samawi/projects/12/views/1?layout=board)

The 6 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Data Model
I utilized Object-Oriented Programming principles extensively throughout this project, leveraging Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views. Django AllAuth served as the user authentication system.

To enable users to create security features, a custom SecurityFeature model was implemented. The 'author' of a security feature is represented as a foreign key to the User model, as each security feature is associated with only one author.

The Comment model facilitates users' ability to comment on individual security features. A security feature is referenced as a foreign key in the Comment model, ensuring that each comment is linked to only one security feature.

Additionally, the SecurityFeature model allows users to add security features to a tech security for a specific day. Each tech security item is associated with one user and one security feature, achieved through foreign key relationships with the User and SecurityFeature models.

The diagram below details the database schema.

![Database Schema](docs/readme_images/database_schema.png)

## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User Authentication

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. 
- Django's UserPassesTestMixin is used to limit access based on certain permissions i.e. to ensure users can only edit/delete securityfeatures and comments for which they are the author. If the user doesn't pass the test they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error. 

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom error pages:

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request - The Easy Eater is unable to handle this request.
- 403 Page Forbidden - Looks like you're trying to access forbidden content. Please log out and sign in to the correct account.
- 404 Page Not Found - The page you're looking for doesn't exist.
- 500 Server Error - The Easy Eater is currently unable to handle this request

## Features

### Header

![header](docs/readme_images/features/nav_loggedout.png)

![header](docs/readme_images/features/header.png)

- The options to Sign up or Log in will change to the option to log out once a user has logged in.
- Once a user has signed in, more options such as 'Add SecurityFeature', 'My Tech Security', 'My SecurityFeatures' and 'My Bookmarks' become available.
- The navigation bar is fully responsive, collapsing into a hamburger menu when the screen size becomes too small.
- Hovering over the links will lighten the font.


### Footer

![header](docs/readme_images/features/footer.png)

- The footer section includes links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube.
- Clicking the links in the footer opens a separate browser tab to avoid pulling the user away from the site.

### Home Page

**Call to Action Section**

![header](docs/readme_images/features/call_out.png)

- The home page includes a call to action section which encourages the user to sign up to the site with the message "Take the stress out of everyday cooking!" and an image of a family dinner.
- The CTA includes a sign up button which takes the user to the sign up page.
- If a user is already signed in the message changes to 'Welcome back to The Easy Eater' and the user is encouraged to create a new securityfeature.
- The sign up button changes to a 'Create' button which takes the user to the 'Add securityfeature' page.
